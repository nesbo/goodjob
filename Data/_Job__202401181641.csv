Please see project brief + description at (https://t.ly/90svA). <br /><br />
If you&#039;re the right option for us, you&#039;ll love it, and you&#039;ll probably know right away. <br /><br />
Lun Drue AS is a Norwegian data focussed marketing consultancy company focussed on services that help businesses perform better - and only doing what impacts businesses the most. We&rsquo;re a dynamic duo with a broad ranged experience within everyting from photography and video production to software development, design, and commercial business development including sales, marketing and PR.<br /><br />
Directly translated to English, Lun Drue means a cool, chill or warm grape - in the way a person would have those characteristics. Being &ldquo;lun&rdquo; is a state of mind, often used to describe someone who is in control, someone who is kind, or someone of a mellow nature. Too cool for school, without bragging or even knowing about it. Your &ldquo;lun&rdquo; friend is the person you seek out when you want a nice evening chilling out, having interesting discussions where your worldview is respected. If you want to go for a walk in the woods without smalltalk, then a &ldquo;lun&rdquo; person is your safe bet. When your better half asks you &ldquo;is he/she nice?&rdquo;, you&rsquo;ll answer &ldquo;yeah, he/she&rsquo;s really lun&rdquo;. <br /><br />
Don&rsquo;t worry about the &ldquo;AS&rdquo; part, it&rsquo;s Norway&rsquo;s &ldquo;Inc.&rdquo; and should be left out of all designs. <br /><br />
Because we believe in the power of freedom, in taking chances in business, and in beauty, we want to keep the brief open ended with respect to our expectations - the only boundaries for our new visual identity is set by your imagination, your creativity and your experience. <br /><br />
Understanding and portraying the essence of &ldquo;lun&rdquo; is important to us.<br /><br />
Read the full brief at (link removed) to get a better understanding of our vision and expectations. <br /><br />
We&#039;ll only consider offers if you&#039;ve read the full brief, and have a clear understanding of what we&#039;re after. Please send ut examples or ideas to give us an understanding of the way you think, and what a project with you would look like. <br /><br />
In this first phase we&#039;re looking for our primary business style in the form of a logo. Down the line, a lot of graphics, templates, manuals etc. will be needed - perhaps also for clients - but initially our identity needs to be created. <br /><br />
A quick overview of the initial project:<br />
*A business logo for Lun Drue (AS), consisting of business name and some sort of graphical element*.<br /><br />
We look forward to hearing from you!<br />

Task #1 Name: Change MacOS Installer from console to UI<br />
* Change post install script - instead of running console UI, run the wrapper app with `--self-config` command-line argument.<br />
* Implement Swift UI in the wrapper app. Create 2 fields allowing for the input of an API Key and API URL. When user clicks on Save - save changes to settings.json and reload launch daemon.<br />
* Determine if a file exists (/usr/local/share/RansomSnare/unattended.instal) - if this file and settings.json exist, don&#039;t show installer UI.<br />
* Move all decisions from postinstall script to the wrapper app.<br />
* Preload settings.json values if the file exists.<br /><br />
Task #2 Name: fix auth_xxx events<br />
- There are about 7 event types auth_create, auth_open, etc. I want to use these ones to implement backup and prevent other apps from writing into RansomSnare folders. Added a little more details<br />
- Right now if I enable these events, MacOS starts freezing.<br />
Goal: Do not allow other apps to modify RansomSnare files in `/usr/local/share/RansomSnare/`.<br />
I want to use ES_EVENT_TYPE_AUTH_OPEN and ES_EVENT_TYPE_AUTH_RENAME to prevent other apps from modifying RansomSnare files<br /><br />

* Display alerts as a separate window (`dialog` mode)<br />
* Display alerts in a notification center (`msgcenter` mode)<br />
* Implement a way to communicate between C# agent and UI app.<br />

I am looking for an incredibly talented developer to develop a work software for scheduling and accounting purposes that will generate invoices and walking logs for both employees and clients. <br /><br />
I would like a website type thing or an app. (but am 100% open to suggestions), OR a software to put on my desktop / laptop that performs tasks similar to quickbooks.&nbsp;&nbsp;This would include scheduling, invoicing, payments, calculations, etc.<br /><br />
I am happy to discuss eventually doing a mobile app. as the company may have to look into connecting the software with employee schedules.&nbsp;&nbsp;But for now, I am more than happy to arrange for something simple and straightforward that works.<br /><br />
You would be required to sign an NDA, and would be developing this simple app for my company to start with.<br /><br />
Essentially the app software would be something simple - similar to or at least with a similar concept to the below softwares and applications:<br /><br />
.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick Books<br />
.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet Check Technology<br />
.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scout for Pets<br />
.&nbsp;&nbsp;Get Jobber<br /><br />
About the app / software...:<br /><br />
Currently, I send out employee schedules and rotas via WhatsApp.&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, these are ever changing, as clients schedules change and they request hour changes, etc. which means constant modifications.<br /><br />
From those schedules, I then input the information in an excel document which almost looks like a calendar numbered 1 - 31 depending on the month.&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy to send my work through.<br /><br />
The excel document contains a header and several columns as the below:<br /><br />
.&nbsp;&nbsp;A header = which contains the Client name<br />
.&nbsp;&nbsp;A column = for the employee performing the job<br />
.&nbsp;&nbsp;A column = for the price the client is paying<br />
.&nbsp;&nbsp;A column = for the employees pay / cut<br />
.&nbsp;&nbsp;A column = for the company pay / cut<br />
.&nbsp;&nbsp;A column = for the day / date<br />
.&nbsp;&nbsp;A column = for the hour / time<br />
.&nbsp;&nbsp;A column = for the task being performed<br />
.&nbsp;&nbsp;A column = for all the totals<br /><br />
example:<br /><br />
Client = Jenny Mc Kenzie<br />
Date = June 15<br />
Hour = 15:00<br />
Class Length = 90 Minutes<br />
What = Ballet Dance Class<br />
Teach Name = Carl Pick<br />
Price = &pound;45<br />
Teacher Pay = &pound;30<br />
Company Cut = &pound;10<br />
VAT = &pound;5<br />
Number of Dance Classes per Month = 10<br />
Total of Each...<br /><br />
I hope this made sense.<br /><br />
From this information - which I literally do in excel and is SO simple and straightforward, I proceed to make invoices by hand.<br /><br />
The invoices are: <br />
a) for clients - to be paid per week<br />
b) for employees - to be paid per month<br /><br />
So basically from the information from the excel document, I then calculate invoices for both.<br /><br />
I would then like to have something that produces another set of information, like a quick ins / outs document so accounting is made simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;So from the invoices produced, we know the company paid x that month or year and made y that month or year.<br /><br />
I hope this all made sense. If it has not, I am happy to send what I currently do / use so that it is all clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would basically mean putting 10 steps into 1 app. / software.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)))<br /><br />
Essentially, I would like something to make schedules - and from the schedules all of the information needed is extracted to send information to employees and clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;From there an invoice would be generated for employees and clients.<br /><br />
That&#039;s all.<br /><br />
Looking forward to choosing amazing talent.<br />
Thanks!<br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $1,500
